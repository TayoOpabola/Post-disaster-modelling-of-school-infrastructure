# Post-disaster-modelling-of-school-infrastructure

The Matlab codes demonstrate algorithms within the proposed methodology for estimating the post-disaster recovery of education infrastructure

The methodology is described in:

Opabola E.A. & Galasso C. "Informing disaster-risk management policies for education infrastructure using scenario-based recovery analyses" (under review).

Each folder contains algorithms for the three case studies presented in the paper.

Case study 1 (Influence of available early response financing mechanisms on education continuity) can be simulated using the folder 'Functionality recovery through temporary learning centers'.

Case study 2 (Influence of management type on the reconstruction time for permanent school buildings) can be simulated using the folder 'Recovery time analysis'.

Case study 3 (Accounting for the influence of socio-political factors on the recovery process) can be simulated using the folder 'Multicriteria Decision Making Analysis'.

A README file is provide in each folder to describe the input files and relevant matlab scripts.
